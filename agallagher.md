Heliography, Daguerreotypes, and the Kodak Brownie are all forms of photography, from the earliest form, heliography, the first permanent form of photography, and one of the first cameras that democratized photography, making it available for everyone, the Kodak Brownie.

# Heliography
## Year invented
1822 (Heliography)

## Created By
Joseph Nicéphore Niépce

## Historical Importance
Used to make the earliest known surviving photograph from nature, View from the Window at Le Gras (1826 or 1827)

## Process
The process used Bitumen of Judea, a naturally occurring asphalt, as a coating on glass or metal. It hardened in proportion to its exposure to light. When the plate was washed with oil of lavender, only the hardened areas remained.

# Daguerreotypes
## Year invented
1839 (Daguerreotypes)

## Created By
Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre

## Historical Importance
Daguerreotypy was the first publicly available photographic process, and for nearly twenty years it was the one most commonly used.

## Process
To make the image, a daguerreotypist would polish a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish, treat it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive, expose it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary, which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting; make the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor; remove its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment, rinse and dry it, then seal the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure.


# Kodak Brownie
## Year invented
1900

## Created By
George Eastman

## Historical Importance
The Brownie invented low-cost photography by introducing the concept of the snapshot to the masses.

## Process
Photographs taken with the cameras are on a roll of film, then sent into Kodak for processing.
