Heliography, Daguerreotypes, and the Kodak Brownie are all forms of photography, from the earliest form, heliography, the first permanent form of photography, and one of the first cameras that democratized photography, making it available for everyone, the Kodak Brownie.

## Year invented
- 1822 (Heliography)
- 1839 (Daguerreotypes)
- 1900 (Kodak Brownie)

# Process
## Heliography
The process used Bitumen of Judea, a naturally occurring asphalt, as a coating on glass or metal. It hardened in proportion to its exposure to light. When the plate was washed with oil of lavender, only the hardened areas remained.
## Daguerreotype
To make the image, a daguerreotypist would polish a sheet of silver-plated copper to a mirror finish, treat it with fumes that made its surface light sensitive, expose it in a camera for as long as was judged to be necessary, which could be as little as a few seconds for brightly sunlit subjects or much longer with less intense lighting; make the resulting latent image on it visible by fuming it with mercury vapor; remove its sensitivity to light by liquid chemical treatment, rinse and dry it, then seal the easily marred result behind glass in a protective enclosure.
## Kodak Brownie
Photograph taken with the cameras are on a roll of film, then sent into Kodak for processing
